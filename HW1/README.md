# HW1

This consists of my work for HW1 for CS131.
The filter reachable function extracts all of the rules from the grammar which are reachable.

To run the program in the OCaml shell:
1. Type 'ocaml' to open the OCaml shell
2. In the shell type: #use "hw1.ml";;
3. To load and run the test cases type: #use "hw1.test";;
